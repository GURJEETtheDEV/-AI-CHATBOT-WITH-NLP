SmartBot is a user-friendly desktop chatbot application that combines rule-based responses with AI-powered conversations. It uses a hybrid approach by first checking for known FAQ responses using NLTK tokenization and, if no match is found, it sends the user input to OpenAIâ€™s GPT model for dynamic, natural language replies. The chatbot is wrapped in a modern graphical interface built with Tkinter, allowing real-time interaction through a simple chat window.
